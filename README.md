# Handsome
Handsome is a project developed within the Deep Tech elective at Centrale Lille, where we are creating a hand mimicry system.  On one side, there is a hand recognition algorithm that detects key points on the hand and extracts the coordinates (either Cartesian or angular) of the phalanges. On the other side, we are building a robotic hand mechanism that reproduces, in real-time, the movements of the captured hand.  In parallel, we are implementing an interface in Blender to preview hand movements using a rigged 3D model.
